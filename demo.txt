Step 1: Run Model_Jupyter.ipynb file

Step 2: It will create a .model file in your directory under 	result folder(made by itself).

Step 3: Now run test.py file

It will record your voice and give you output. Please consider the surrounding and noise. Also consider the pitch of voice.

The output of test.py will depend upon the model made by Model_Jupyter.ipynb file. So if it will give error, please check the path of result folder and mlp_classifier.model file.
