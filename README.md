# Speech Emotion Recognition

This command line application helps you to find out the emotions of speech using MLP Classifier of Scikit learn library.
 - You need to run the Model_jupyter.ipynb file.
 - It will create a .model file in your directory under 	result folder(made by itself).
 - Now run test.py file.
 It will record your voice and give you output. Please consider the surrounding and noise. Also consider the pitch of voice.

## In case of any Error
The output of test.py will depend upon the model made by Model_Jupyter.ipynb file. So if it will give error, please check the path of result folder and mlp_classifier.model file.
